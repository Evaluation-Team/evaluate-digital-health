    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Map how your product will create change</h1>

    <p>To conduct an evaluation, you need to know what your product does and how you expect this to create the change you want. This can help you to identify gaps in the evidence for how your product works and help you to improve the design of the product. For example, how will your app to stop people smoking actually increase the proportion of people giving up smoking?</p>
    <p>You might know this mapping process by names such as logic model, theory of change or benefit mapping. If you have already mapped how your product works, it is still useful to revisit this when planning your evaluation.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why create a model</h2>

    <p>It’s useful to create a model to represent how a product is expected to work. This can be shown as a diagram to help you visualise the different processes and how they fit together.</p>
    <p>It is a high-level view of the programme’s components and how you intend them to produce certain health outcomes. It doesn’t need to model the programme in step-by-step detail. The focus is on understanding how the digital product should work for the purposes of evaluating it.</p>
    <p>Models vary but commonly show:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>inputs</li>
    <li>outputs</li>
    <li>impact – positive and negative</li>
    <li>context</li>
    <li>the relationship between these elements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These elements are usually shown in a simple flow chart from left to right, with arrows indicating how one step leads to another.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to structure a model for a digital health product</h2>
    <p>These are the main areas you might want to cover, followed by a case study showing how this could work in practice.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>Explain the problem that you are trying to solve or the opportunity you are exploring. Think about what your digital health product needs to do to be successful.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Assumptions</h3>
    <p>Consider any assumptions that you have about your project. This can include assumptions about your users, your team and resources, and the external environment.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Context</h3>
    <p>Describe factors outside your project that could influence how it works. For example, the users of your health product and the wider policies or strategies that it supports.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Barriers</h3>
    <p>Discuss any constraints that might prevent users from taking actions you would expect, or keep your product from being successful. For example, users might lack the motivation to change their behaviour.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Think about how you expect your digital health product to improve the public's health. Health outcomes are the changes you are trying to bring about in your users’ health or wellbeing. For example, you might want to improve their fitness levels.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Functions and responses</h3>
    <p>Functions are things your product does to encourage the user towards outcomes that will improve their health.</p>
    <p>Responses are how your user responds to the functions. This will often be a change in their behaviour.</p>
    <p>Consider how your health product, and its interactions with your users, could achieve your chosen health outcomes. What specific things will your intervention do to make them happen? You should also think about how your health product could negatively impact on any health outcomes.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Creating your model</h2>
    <p>Models of how a product works are usually designed by a team rather than individuals. <a href=logicmodelworkshop.html target="_blank">Hold a workshop</a> with people involved in your project to develop your model together. The next page explains how to do this.</p>
    <p>You should develop your model as early as possible – as soon as you have an idea of the outcomes your product is aiming to achieve. This will help you evaluate your design process, as well as the product itself. Create your model in the discovery phase if you are using an <a href=https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery target="_blank">agile delivery process.</a> You can then revisit this when planning an evaluation.</p>
    <p>If you haven’t already created a written model of how your product works, you can do this when planning an evaluation.</p>

<div class="filter-results-box">
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Case study: Couch to 5K</h2>
    <p>The Couch to 5K team created a model of how their product works together at an in-person workshop.</p>
    <p>First, they framed their hypothesis: that their app would help users be more active and lose weight.</p>
    <p>Then, they thought about how this would be expressed as individual health outcomes, from short to long term. For example:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>using the app makes people more confident about running</li>
    <li>users start running as directed by the app, meaning they are successful at following the instructions</li>
    <li>this means users are more like to go running in a sustained manner</li>
    <li>this increase in physical activity improves fitness and improve BMI</li>
    <li>these changes would improve individuals’ long-term health</li>
    </ul>
