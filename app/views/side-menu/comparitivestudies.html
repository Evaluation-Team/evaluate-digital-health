<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Comparative studies</h1>
<p>Comparative studies are good for evaluating the clinical effectiveness of a digital health product when you are launching it (summative evaluation). Certain types of comparative study are very robust. Because of this, they are recommended in the <a href=https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/evidence-standards-framework-for-digital-health-technologies target="_blank">NICE Evidence Standards Framework</a> for several types of digital product.</p>
<p>To judge whether a digital health product or service is effective, you need to make some sort of comparison to what the alternative would be. If this product didn’t exist, what would have happened. The alternative might be nothing, an existing non-digital service, or a different digital product or service.</p>
<p>For example, a group of people who have some anxiety problems use your new app. 6 months later, 30% report they no longer have anxiety problems. Does this prove that the app is effective? No. Some people recover from anxiety problems over time without outside assistance. We need to compare whether more people recovered using the app than would have without the app.</p>
<p>Comparative studies usually involve collecting data on individuals who are not given your product. This will be more complex and expensive than a typical descriptive study. The choice of comparison is important. Some comparisons are easier and cheaper to make, but may not be fair. You will have to find a balance between having a very robust evaluation and what is practical and affordable.</p>
<p>Examples of comparative studies:</p>

<!--Benchmarking-->
<hr style="">&nbsp;</hr>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="abtesting.html">Benchmarking</a></h3>
<p>You could measure outcomes from using the app against a benchmark figure. Statistics are available for standard outcomes from typical problems. This is a very easy approach, but will work best with topics where there is a lot of information available on what usually happens.</p>

<!--Before/after studies-->
<hr style="">&nbsp;</hr>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="abtesting.html">Before/after studies</a></h3>
<p>A common approach is to collect data, in the same context, on what happens before you introduce a product with what happens after you have introduced it. This ensures a lot of similarity between your two conditions. However, you cannot be sure that the differences between before and after are just because of your product. There may have been other changes happening at the same time, for example, there may be a background trend of increasing or decreasing problems.</p>

<!--Natural experiments and non-randomised controls-->
<hr style="">&nbsp;</hr>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="abtesting.html">Natural experiments and non-randomised controls</a></h3>
<p>Your digital product could be introduced in one area, but not another. Sometimes this is done as a deliberate choice for an evaluation. Sometimes this happens for other reasons and you can piggyback on this to carry out an evaluation – known as a natural experiment.</p>
<p>This can be good because it controls for background changes over time. If there is a background trend, it should affect both areas the same. However, there may be systematic differences between the two regions, meaning the comparison is not fair.</p>

<!--Patient preference designs-->
<hr style="">&nbsp;</hr>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="abtesting.html">Patient preference designs</a></h3>
<p>You may have different services available to users, with users choosing between a digital and non-digital service. We can compare outcomes in these two groups. This may be very easy. However, this is not a fair comparison, because people who want a particular service are different to people who want an alternative service. Showing something works well for people who particularly want it does not necessarily mean it will work well more generally.</p>

<!--Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)-->
<hr style="">&nbsp;</hr>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="abtesting.html">Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)</a></h3>
<p>Also known as randomised clinical trials. RCTs are often considered the best way of evaluating clinical effectiveness. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, each receiving a different intervention – for example, one group using your product and one group using a different product. This random allocation ensures that the people in each group are, on average, the same as each other, allowing a fair comparison between the interventions.</p>

<!--A/B testing-->
<hr style="">&nbsp;</hr>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="abtesting.html">A/B testing</a></h3>
<p>A/B testing is effectively a randomised controlled trial for a design choice. It’s often associated with websites and apps. Participants are randomly sent to one of two versions of something – for example, a website page using two different fonts and text sizes. Because of this random allocation, we can ensure that the people in each group are, on average, the same as each other, allowing a fair comparison between the versions.</p>
