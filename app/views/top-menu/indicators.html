    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Choose success indicators</h1>
    <p>An indicator is a measure that shows the impact of the intervention. Health indicators are the measurable signs of the impact of your digital health intervention is having on people’s health and wellbeing.</p>
    <p>Establishing the most appropriate indicators will help you to understand what impact your digital health intervention is having. Understanding the impact will help you iterate the design of the intervention and better improve your chosen health outcomes.</p>

    <div class="filter-results-box">
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Case study: Couch to 5K</h2>
        <p>When the Couch to 5K team were looking for relevant indicators, they first searched Fingertips – PHE’s database of regional health data.</p>
        <p>Here, they found indicators relevant to their project, like the proportion of adults doing 30 to 145 minutes of physical activity per week. This indicator could help them prove that they’d promoted physical activity in the wider population. Using common indicators like this would also let them compare their app to similar services.</p>
        <p>They also designed indicators specific to their app, using data collected from within the app itself – like the proportion of users who went for a run after getting a push notification.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to choose your indicators</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Prioritising health outcomes</h3>
    <p>The indicators you choose will be closely related to your chosen health outcomes. Each health outcome is likely to have multiple indicators to understand whether it's being met or not. If you don’t already know which health outcomes your digital health intervention targets, then <a href="logicmodel.html">creating a logic model</a> with your team is the best way to identify them.</p>
    <p>When deciding which outcomes to focus on, consider:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>what you can practically measure</li>
    <li>which outcomes could have the most direct impact on your project’s aims</li>
    <li>the priorities of your organisation, stakeholders or partners</li>
    <li>for each outcome you want to measure, you’ll need at least one indicator</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Creating your own indicators</h2>
    <p>Looking at your chosen outcomes, think about what will indicate that you have reached that outcome. Some indicators will be specific to your product, for example: number of downloads, or number of people self-reporting closer to average BMI after using your product. Choose indicators that you are able to measure, and that will give you an indication as to whether you have met your outcome.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Using existing indicators</h2>
    <p>Using existing indicators will help you compare your health product to other health interventions, and it’s more likely that data will already be available. You can use Public Health England’s database, <a href=https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/>Fingertips</a>, to find common indicators in some public health areas.</p>
