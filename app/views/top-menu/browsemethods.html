    <!--Randomised control trial-->
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="abtesting.html">Randomised Control Trial</a></h3>
    <p>A study in which a number of similar people are randomly assigned to 2 (or more) groups (also called arms) to test a specific drug, treatment or other intervention. One group (the experimental group) has the intervention being tested, the other (the comparison or control group) has an alternative intervention, a dummy intervention (placebo) or no intervention at all.</p>
    <!--Multivariate testing-->
    <hr style="">&nbsp;</hr>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="abtesting.html">Multivariate testing</a></h3>
    <p>Multivariate testing is a way of testing complex products or services which have multiple elements or components.Teams create variations of the different elements of an app or website. These are then combined to create multiple different versions of the entire app or website.This approach is in contrast to A/B testing, which is designed to test just one variation or change at a time using two different sets of users.</p>
  <!--ab testing-->
    <hr style="">&nbsp;</hr>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="abtesting.html">A/B Testing</a></h3>
    <p>A/B testing involves comparing two different versions of a thing, to see which performs better. It helps you understand how the differences between the two versions affect users’ behaviour and outcomes.</p>
  <!--focus group-->
  <hr style="">&nbsp;</hr>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="abtesting.html">Focus group</a></h3>
  <p>Spending time with a group of participants carrying out qualitative research in order to learn about a specifi topic. Encouraging discussion in order to learn about a topic.</p>
  <!--interupted time series-->
  <hr style="">&nbsp;</hr>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="abtesting.html">Interupted time series</a></h3>
  <p>Multiple measurements are taken using serial quantitative surveys before, during and after an intervention – or before and during if an intervention is the introduction of something routine or permanent. Each measurement is taken from a sample of the same population, instead of the same people being followed up, as in a RCT or non-randomised study.</p>
