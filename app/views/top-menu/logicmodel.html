    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Create a logic model</h1>

    <p>A logic model is a visual diagram that shows how a digital health product will work.</p>
    <p>It shows how things like inputs, outputs and activities relate to each other, and how these might produce certain health outcomes.</p>
    <p>It does not model the actual program in step-by-step detail. Instead, it’s a higher level view of the program’s components and outputs.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How a logic model supports your evaluation</h2>

    <p>You can use a logic model to align your team and build a consensus on what the intended health outcomes of your product are, and how you’ll achieve them.</p>
    <p>Logic models are usually designed by a team rather than individuals. We recommend holding a workshop with people involved in your project to develop your logic model together.</p>
    <p>You should develop your logic model as early as possible – as soon as you have an idea of the outcomes your product is aiming to achieve. This will help you evaluate your design process, as well as the product itself.</p>

<div class="filter-results-box">
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Case study: Couch to 5K</h2>
    <p>The Couch to 5K team built their logic model together at an in-person workshop.</p>
    <p>First, they framed their hypothesis: that their app would help users be more active and lose weight.</p>
    <p>Then, they thought about how this would be expressed as individual health outcomes, from short to long term. Next, they considered the specific outputs their service could create to help reach those outcomes, like “App that encourages users to complete a 5K run”.</p>
    <p>Once it was completed, the team’s logic model gave them a clear and standardised overview of their project’s components.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to create a logic model</h2>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Hypothesis and Assumptions<h3>
    <p>Explain the problem you are trying to solve or the opportunity you are exploring. Consider any assumptions that you have about the your project. Think about what your health product needs to do to be successful. </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Outcomes<h3>
    <p>Think about how your health product could improve the public's health, and decide on the health outcomes that your health product is trying to achieve. Health outcomes are the direct and specific results of an intervention, usually for those receiving the care or otherwise targeted. These might include things like reducing diabetes rates. </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Inputs and activities<h3>
    <p>List the resources you have available for your project, including your budget, equipment and the people and organisations working on it. Decide on the processes, events, technology and actions you will use to deliver your health product.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Outputs<h3>
    <p>Consider how your health product, and its interactions with your users, could achieve your chosen health outcomes. What specific things will your intervention need to deliver to make them happen? You may also think about how your health product could negatively impact on these health outcomes.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Context and barriers<h3>
    <p>Describe the users of your health product, the policies or strategies that it supports, and the funding you have. Discuss any constraints that may stop you from delivering your health product, or keep it from being successful.</p>
